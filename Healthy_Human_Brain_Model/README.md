## Healthy_Human_Brain_Model
This contains the testing code (or more accurately, the inference code) for the Healthy Human Brain Model reported in our manuscript. The model architecture and the implementation of the inference procedure are included in "./deep_learning_model/". The actual scripts to run are located in "../Demo_scripts/" in the parent folder of the this folder.

### deep_learning_model


### saved_model_weights
This folder is supposed to contain one file, "ResAttU_Net-SGD-0.1000-CVPR_Adaptive_loss-4-epoch18.pkl". However, that file is too large for GitHub and can only be accessed through Google Drive as described previously. If you do have the access, please make sure you place that file in the correct location (inside "./saved_model_weights/") once you downloaded it.
