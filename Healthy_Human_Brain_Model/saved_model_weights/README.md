## saved_model_weights

As explained previously, the trained model weight is too large (> 100 MB) to be stored here on GitHub. We have to host these data files on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l5GU6E0iCHbs24ZNzN6uIQgbQud1DZ3e?usp=sharing).

Please make sure you place the file in the correct location (this folder) once you downloaded it.
