## Demo_scripts

This folder contains the key scripts we organized for demonstration of how to reproduce some results described in our manuscript. We will briefly describe what each of these four scripts does.

Before executing any of these scripts, you would need to download the missing scans and model weights using the Google Drive link you requested (for now we are prioritizing this service to the editors and reviewers), and place the downloaded folders in the correct locations which shall be clearly depicted in the ["Overview of this repository"](https://github.com/SAIL-GuoLab/DeepContrast_Demo#overview-of-this-repository) section. Moreover, you would need to configure an anaconda environment as described [here](https://github.com/SAIL-GuoLab/DeepContrast_Demo#preparing-the-anaconda-environment-to-execute-the-code) and [here](https://github.com/SAIL-GuoLab/DeepContrast_Demo/tree/master/Environment_setup). Lastly, once everything is done and as the last prepratory step, you can activate the environment.

```
conda activate DeepContrast
```
