## Test_retest_data_complete 

Ideally there shall be five folders here, namely:

```
├── (*) NatureBME_share_nonContrast
├── (*) NatureBME_share_GBCAuptake
├── (*) NatureBME_share_GBCApredicted
├── (*) NatureBME_share_brainMask
└── (*) NatureBME_share_tissueLabel
 ```
 
Due to the file size limit imposed by GitHub, we have to host these data files on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l5GU6E0iCHbs24ZNzN6uIQgbQud1DZ3e?usp=sharing).

One additional note: after you download the NifTI scans in '.nii.gz' format, please do not attempt to unzip them. Their current format saves space, and more importantly our current code only works with '.nii.gz' files.
