## Test_retest_data_complete 

Ideally there shall be five folders here, namely:

```
├── (*) NatureBME_share_nonContrast
├── (*) NatureBME_share_GBCAuptake
├── (*) NatureBME_share_GBCApredicted
├── (*) NatureBME_share_brainMask
└── (*) NatureBME_share_tissueLabel
 ```
 
Unfortunately due to the file size limit imposed by GitHub, we have to host these data files on Google Drive. Currently the link to the Google Drive folder is only shared to the Chief Editor, who can then forward it to the reviewers. These data shall be available upon reasonable request to Jia Guo (jg3400@columbia.edu) after permission from the Columbia Technology Ventures Office of Intellectual Property.
